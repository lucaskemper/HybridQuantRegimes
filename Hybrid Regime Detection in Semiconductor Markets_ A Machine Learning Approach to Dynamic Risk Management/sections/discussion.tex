\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implementation Status and Limitations}
Several implementation constraints and limitations merit consideration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex result structures requiring detailed knowledge of internal implementation
    \item Basic error handling that could be improved
    \item Limited to daily return data
    \item Focus on semiconductor sector specifics
    \item Computational intensity of deep learning component
\end{itemize}

These limitations provide context for interpreting the following results and suggest areas for future development.

\subsection{Regime Detection Performance}
My hybrid regime detection framework \citep{hamilton1989new, fischer2018deep} demonstrates several key strengths:

\subsubsection{Model Robustness}
The implementation shows robust performance through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic fallback mechanisms when deep learning predictions fail \citep{hochreiter1997long}
    \item Conservative regime selection in the ensemble approach
    \item Comprehensive validation metrics including AIC, BIC, and regime persistence \citep{ang2002regime}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Regime Stability}
The analysis reveals stable regime identification with \citep{guidolin2011regime}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High persistence rates (>80\%) across all regimes
    \item Clear regime boundaries defined by empirical quantiles
    \item Effective smoothing mechanisms reducing spurious transitions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Management Implications}

\subsubsection{Conditional Risk Assessment}
The regime-dependent risk metrics \citep{mcneil2015quantitative} provide valuable insights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic VaR and Expected Shortfall calculations \citep{artzner1999coherent}
    \item Regime-specific correlation structures \citep{engle2002dynamic}
    \item Extreme value analysis for tail risk assessment \citep{mcneil2000estimation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Portfolio Management Applications}
The framework enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic position sizing based on regime characteristics
    \item Early warning signals for regime transitions
    \item Risk-adjusted portfolio rebalancing opportunities
