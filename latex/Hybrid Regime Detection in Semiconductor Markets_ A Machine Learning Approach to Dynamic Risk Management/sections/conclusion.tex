\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This paper presents a hybrid regime detection and dynamic risk overlay framework tailored to semiconductor equities—a sector marked by innovation cycles, macro sensitivity, and abrupt transitions. The architecture combines the probabilistic structure of Gaussian Hidden Markov Models with the temporal modeling capacity of LSTM and Transformer-based networks. These models are fused through entropy-weighted Bayesian averaging into a robust regime classification system that conditions trading signals and adapts risk exposure in real time.

While the hybrid system underperforms passive and naive momentum strategies in terms of raw return, it delivers materially improved drawdown control and significantly lower volatility. The framework achieves over a 50\% reduction in annualized volatility and a 15--17 percentage point drawdown improvement relative to static strategies—highlighting its utility as a regime-aware risk overlay rather than an alpha engine.

The modular infrastructure supports both batch and live deployment, with dedicated components for preprocessing, regime detection, signal generation, and dynamic risk control. Transformer-based detectors and meta-model blending extend adaptability, offering a foundation for production-ready implementation across markets and asset classes.

Limitations remain. The deep learning components offered marginal improvement over simpler models—likely due to the sector’s strong regime persistence and well-separated latent states. Additionally, the feature set is primarily price-based and hand-engineered, which may constrain predictive power. Finally, the evaluation is limited to a single sector and five-year period, albeit one that includes multiple shocks (e.g., COVID-19, 2022 tech correction).

Promising directions for future research include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multimodal Regime Learning:} Integrating textual (e.g., earnings sentiment), visual, or macro features for narrative-aware signal detection
    \item \textbf{Online Adaptation:} Embedding reinforcement or meta-learning to handle nonstationarity and model drift
    \item \textbf{Explainability:} Leveraging SHAP, counterfactuals, or attention maps to improve transparency and institutional trust
    \item \textbf{Portfolio Construction:} Using regime signals in optimization routines to time factors, allocate capital, and hedge tails
    \item \textbf{Systemic Risk Overlay:} Extending regime models across equities, credit, and rates to detect contagion and co-movement
\end{itemize}

In sum, this work contributes a flexible, interpretable, and production-oriented regime detection system. While not an alpha source in isolation, it offers substantial real-world value through volatility suppression, adaptive risk control, and regime-aware structural awareness—critical components of resilient portfolio management in nonlinear markets.
