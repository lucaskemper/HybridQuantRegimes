Semiconductor equities exhibit high volatility and sharp regime transitions, challenging traditional risk models.
This paper introduces a hybrid regime detection and risk overlay framework combining Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, fused via entropy-weighted Bayesian averaging.
The system detects real-time market regimes and adjusts portfolio exposure dynamically using regime-specific volatility, drawdown, and confidence signals.
Tested on a 5-year out-of-sample semiconductor portfolio (SMH, NVDA, AMD, TSM, etc.), the strategy reduces annualized volatility by over 50\% and improves max drawdown by ~15 percentage points compared to passive benchmarks.
While not designed for alpha generation, the framework functions as a deployable, interpretable overlay for institutional portfolios requiring adaptive de-risking and robust volatility suppression.
The architecture is modular, production-ready, and extensible to other sectors.
