Semiconductor equity markets present unique challenges for regime detection due to rapid innovation cycles, high volatility, and sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Traditional models often fail to adapt to the abrupt regime shifts that characterize this sector. This work introduces a hybrid framework that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and deep learning architectures (LSTM/Transformer), integrating semiconductor-specific and macro-financial features, Bayesian model averaging for regime probability fusion, and a dynamic risk management engine that adapts position sizing and risk controls in real time. The system is tailored for the semiconductor sector and validated with realistic backtesting, including transaction costs and Monte Carlo scenario analysis. In out-of-sample tests (2019â€“2024), the framework achieved an annualized return of 5.5%, volatility of 8.5%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.41, with regime persistence above 94% and a low-risk profile. These results indicate that the approach provides adaptive performance and effective risk mitigation for practitioners and researchers navigating volatile, regime-shifting markets.
